## Ingredients
- 12 oz. (340 g) Salmon, cut into 2-3 fillet strips
- Salt
- Black Pepper
- 1 pinch of Cayenne Pepper
- 2 tablespoons of Honey
- 1 tablespoon warm water
- 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil
- 1 tablespoon of Minced Garlic
- 1 tablespoon of Parsley
- 1 1/2 teaspoons of Apple Cider Vinegar or Lemon Juice
- 1/2 lemon, sliced into wedges
## Instructions
1. Season the surface of the salmon with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Set aside.
2. Mix the honey, water, apple cider vinegar or lemon juice and a pinch of salt together. Stir to combine well.
3. Heat up an oven-safe skillet (cast-iron skillet preferred) on high heat. Add the olive oil. Pan-fry the salmon, skin side down first, for about 1 minute. Turn the salmon over and cook for 1 minute. Turn it over again so the skin side is at the bottom.
4. Add the garlic into the pan, saute until slightly browned. Add the honey mixture and lemon wedges into the skillet, reduce the sauce until it's sticky.
5. Finish it off by broiling the salmon in the oven for 1 minute or until the surface becomes slightly charred (optional step).
6. Top the salmon with parsley and serve immediately. Internal temperature should reach 125 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Oven Version
I just use oil. I coat the entire fillet (or steak) in veggie oil or olive oil, and put it skin-side-down in an old pan into a preheated 450+ degree oven. You'll have to try this like 10 times in order to learn your exact oven temperature and salmon cooking time. When I cook a 140 gram (1/3 lb) fillet for myself that's about 3 cm (1 1/4 inch) thick, I cook it about 9 minutes 50 seconds. (Don't open the oven while it's cooking.) Eat the salmon the instant it doesn't burn your mouth. It should melt in your mouth.

I've also seen people sprinkle sugar on top of the oil before cooking, and that comes out nicely. When peaches or apricots or plums are in season, sometimes I chop one up and add it on top of the salmon _after_ the salmon is cooked. Or, as you say, salmon goes well with soy sauce, sesame oil, etc. But properly cooked salmon is delicious all by itself with only veggie oil, so everything else is optional.

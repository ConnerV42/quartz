## Articles
- [7 March 2022, Bretton Woods III - Zoltan Pozsar](https://plus2.credit-suisse.com/shorturlpdf.html?v=4ZR9-WTBd-VA)
> We are witnessing the birth of Bretton Woods III – a new world (monetary) order centered around commodity-based currencies in the East that will likely weaken the Eurodollar system and also contribute to inflationary forces in the West.
- [Nuclear Reactor proposal in Washington State](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/this-next-generation-nuclear-power-plant-is-pitched-for-washington-state-can-it-change-the-world/)
> X-energy, along with Bellevue-based TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, and Portland-based NuScale, proposes reactors that can ramp up and down their electrical output much more rapidly than the large reactors now operating.
> This agility could help keep electrical grids in balance as more wind and solar power comes online.

## Sites
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)
> We believe that a key reason why we fail to achieve the progress we are capable of is that we do not make enough use of this existing research and data: the important knowledge is often stored in inaccessible databases, locked away behind paywalls and buried under jargon in academic papers. 
> The goal of our work is to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable. As we say on [our homepage](https://ourworldindata.org/), Our World in Data is to publish the **_“research and data to make progress against the world’s largest problems”._**
- [What Is Nuclear](https://whatisnuclear.com)
> Because nuclear fuel contains so much more energy in a small mass than anything else, it’s possible to keep all the byproducts accounted for and out of the biosphere, in strong contrast to fossil and biofuels which release much of their combustion wastes into the air. Crucially, splitting atoms is a carbon-free process, so nuclear power is a potential global solution to climate change.

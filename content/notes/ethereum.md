- Bitcoin has a philosophy of only "soft-forking", which means that every future network update must be backwards compatible. Hard forks, on the other hand, always create a chain split, the old chain is often abandoned, which Ethereum has managed to operationalize well. Ethereum has hard forked 10 times (source: [History of Ethereum Hard Forks](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-history-of-ethereum-hard-forks-6a6dae76d56f). Soft forks can be thought of as simple "network upgrades", while hard forks literally create 2 networks, the nodes on one network running the new, non-backwards compatible software, while the nodes on the old network are still running the previous, incompatible version of software.

-   olive oil spray

## Instructions
1. Make sure the air fryer is clean.
2. Spray the air fryer basket with olive oil spray, then place the frozen broccoli florets in the basket. For best results, do not allow the broccoli to thaw at all prior to baking, place it straight from the freezer into the air fryer.
3. Spray the broccoli florets with olive oil spray, then sprinkle on the salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. Give the basket a shake to mix the spices around.
4. Air fry at 400 degrees for 10 minutes. Stir and shake the basket, then air fry an additional 5-15 minutes, until desired level of crispiness.
5. Top with Parmesan cheese and serve.

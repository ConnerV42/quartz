## Cooking Instructions
1. Season Shrimp

3. Saute Chopped Bacon & Cook Shrimp
	- If you're using uncooked shrimp, remove the bacon from the pan once it is almost crisp, while keeping the fat in the pan. Aim for about one tablespoon of fat in the pan to use for cooking shrimp. Add the shrimp, while making sure the pan is hot.
	- if you're using cooked shrimp, wait until the bacon pieces are already mostly cooked, then throw the cooked shrimp to reheat.
	- Immediately throw in 1 tbsp of minced garlic, 2 tbsp of green onion, and 1 tbsp of minced jalapeno. Stir diligently.
	- Toss bacon back in with 1/4 cup of water, 2 tbsp of cream, 2 tsp of lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce.
	- As sauce forms, mix in 1 tbsp of parsley.
	- Serve in a bowl, sauce over shrimp over grits.

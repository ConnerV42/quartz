## Introduction

Proof of Stake is an alternative mechanism to [Proof of Work](/notes/proof-of-work.md) used by many cryptocurrency networks to achieve consensus on which new blocks to add to their blockchains.

In PoS, your political control in the system in a function of your wealth in the system.

## Issues with Proof of Stake
PoS gives more mining power to block validators based on the percentage of coins a given validator holds. So the larger your holdings, the more weight is given to your vote in achieving network consensus. You also receive a disproportionately large reward for validating blocks, compared to those that have less coins but provide the same service to the network. Over time, PoS centralizes the majority of consensus to a small number of validators that hold the most coins.

Comparing PoS to the monetary system in the US, and they are very similar. You're incentivized to invest money in assets like stocks, real estate, etc. because that's how you make a return on your money and outpace inflation. if you're an ultra high net worth individual, you can even afford to hire lobbyists to influence the laws that are made, or lawyers to help you find loopholes in the existing tax code. The more money you have, the easier it is to influence the system. This is not bad in and of itself, because if you can acquire capital, you are likely a competent person who is deserving of the money that you've made. But a bad actor takes the capital they've accumulated, and uses it to exploit and change the rules of the system to benefit themselves, it becomes harder for the system as a whole to continue to provide opportunity for good actors starting at the bottom rung and working their way upwards.

A key governance difference between a Proof of Stake network and a Proof of Work network is that in Proof of Stake, more money affords you more power over the stewardship of the network. The more money you stake, the larger your yield will become, which over a long enough time horizon will consolidate wealth.

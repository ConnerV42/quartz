## PrivateLink
- AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS services, and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the public internet. AWS PrivateLink makes it easy to connect services across different accounts and VPCs to significantly simplify your network architecture.
- [VPC Interface Endpoints](/notes/aws/vpc-interface-endpoints.md), powered by AWS PrivateLink, connect you to services hosted by AWS Partners and supported solutions available in AWS Marketplace. By powering [Gateway Load Balancer endpoints,](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway-load-balancer.html) AWS PrivateLink brings the same level of security and performance to your virtual network appliances or custom traffic inspection logic.

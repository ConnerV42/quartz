## **MQ**
- Amazon MQ is a messaging service that is suitable for anyone using messaging with existing applications and wanting to move their messaging service to the cloud quickly and easily. It supports industry standard APIs and protocols like JMS, NMS, AMQP, STOMP, MQTT, and WebSocket. so you can switch from any standards-based message broker to Amazon MQ without rewriting the messaging code in your applications.

- **AWS Backup** enables you to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services and hybrid workloads. AWS Backup offers a cost-effective, fully managed, policy-based service that further simplifies data protection at scale.

Together with AWS Organizations, AWS Backup enables you to centrally deploy data protection policies to configure, manage, and govern your backup activity across your organizationâ€™s AWS accounts and resources, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) databases (including Amazon Aurora clusters), Amazon DynamoDB tables, Amazon Neptune databases, Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) databases, Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file systems, Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems, and AWS Storage Gateway volumes, and VMware workloads on premises and in VMware CloudTM on AWS. AWS Backup also offers a preview for backup and restore of Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets.

## **Fargate**
- AWS Fargate is a general purpose container compute platform. You can run a persistent container that stays up for weeks, and binds to an an IP address to receive HTTP requests and serve web pages, or supply a REST API. You can also use it like AWS Batch though, by using the RunTask API to launch a containerized task that runs to completion and exits. Fargate is general purpose and you can do more things with it.

## AWS Glue
- AWS Glue is a serverless, fully managed extract, transform, and load (ETL) service that makes it easy for customers to prepare and load their data for analytics. you can create and run an ETL job with a few clicks in the AWS Management Console. You simply point AWS Glue to your data stored on AWS, and AWS Glue discovers your data and stores the associated metadata (e.g. table definition and schema) in the AWS Glue Data Catalog. Once cataloged, your data is immediately searchable, queryable, and available for ETL. AWS Glue generates the code to execute your data transformations and data loading processes.

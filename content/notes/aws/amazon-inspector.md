		- `RecognizedPortNoAgent`
		- `UnrecognizedPortWithListener`
- With Inspector, rules packages determine what is checked 
- Agent can provide additional OS visibility, such as 


Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS Workloads for vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans EC2 instances and container images residing in ECR for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

When a software vulnerability or network issue is discovered, Amazon Inspector creates a finding. A finding describes the vulnerability, identifies the affected resource, rates the severity of the vulnerability, and provides remediation guidance. Details of a finding for your account can be analyzed in multiple ways using the Amazon Inspector console, or you can view and process your findings through other AWS services.

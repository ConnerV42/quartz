## **IoT Core**
- AWS IoT Core is a managed cloud service that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT Core provides secure communication and data processing across different kinds of connected devices and locations so you can easily build IoT applications. AWS IoT Core allows you to connect multiple devices to the cloud and to other devices without requiring you to deploy or manage any servers. You can also filter, transform, and act upon device data on the fly based on the rules you define. With AWS IoT Core, your applications can keep track of and communicate with all of your devices, all the time, even when they aren't connected.

Inscribed within the block was a message. It read: \"**The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks**.\"\n\nThe United States is indebted to the tune of [$30 trillion](https://usdebtclock.org/) dollars. Bitcoin's success since its inception is a fascinating emergent response to the growing instability of the American financial system. This is a living document in which I try to make sense of what Bitcoin is on a technical, economic, environmental and political level.\n\n- [Proof Of Stake](/notes/proof-of-stake.md) \n\n## Bitcoin Energy Usage\n Bitcoin, as a decentralized network, is resilient to [51% attacks](/notes/51-attack.md) in large part because of it's energy usage through a process called [Proof of Work](/notes/proof-of-work.md). The electricity usage of the Bitcoin network, while jarring, is intentional to the design of the system. A measurement of the total hashing capability of the network is taken bi-weekly. That measurement is used as an input to calculate the _difficulty target_, or the amount of electrical work required to produce a valid Proof of Work block over a 10 minute period. This bi-weekly re-targeting is called the _difficulty adjustment_, and exists to artificially slow the production of Bitcoin blocks across time. This fundamentally limits the transaction throughput capability of the Bitcoin network because each transaction needs to be recorded into a block, and block space is finite, and capped at around 1 MB.\n- Bitcoin consumes a substantial amount of energy. In 2021, the entire world used 154,620 TWh of energy. Bitcoin mining consumed 188 TWh, equal to 0.12% of global energy production.\n\t- Bitcoin is powered by a [higher mix of renewable energy](https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2021.10.19-Q3-BMC-Presentation-Materials-Final.pdf) than any major country or industry.\n\t- 10,463 TWh total energy is used to generate \u0026 distribute electricity in the US. 6,800 TWh of that energy is wasted or lost. Bitcoin miners operate on small margins, and chase the cheapest source of energy globally, and this is often otherwise wasted energy.\n\t- 65% of all energy used to generate \u0026 distribute electricity in the US is lost or wasted.\n\n## How are transactions verified in Bitcoin?\nOwnership of bitcoin is established through _digital keys_, _bitcoin addresses_, and _digital signatures_. The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created and stored by users in a file called a _wallet_. The digital keys in a user’s wallet are completely independent of the bitcoin protocol and can be generated and managed by the user’s wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the Internet. Keys enable many of the interesting properties of bitcoin, including de-centralized trust and control, ownership attestation, and the cryptographic-proof security model.\n\nEvery Bitcoin address contains a public and private key, generated using the SHA-256 encryption algorithm, which is thought of to be impossible to reverse-engineer. The public key is used to ensure that you are the owner of an address that can receive funds. You need to have the private key for an address in order to spend from it.\n\nSHA-256 is mathematical function that is practically irreversible, meaning that it is easy to calculate in one direction, but infeasible to calculate in the opposite direction (albeit, not impossible). Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and digital signatures that cannot be forged. Bitcoin uses elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its public key cryptography.\n\nIn bitcoin, we use public key cryptography to create a key pair that controls access to bitcoins. The key pair consists of a private key and—derived from it—a unique public key. The public key is used to receive bitcoins, and the private key is used to sign transactions to spend those bitcoins.\n\nThere is a mathematical relationship between the public and the private key that allows the private key to be used to generate signatures on messages. This signature can be validated against the public key without revealing the private key.\n\n## Incentives of Bitcoin \n- Incentives are what govern the Bitcoin network. If the majority of miners ever found themselves paying more in electricity costs than the value they earn from their Bitcoin, they would simply quit mining. In that scenario, Bitcoin could be left vulnerable to a 51% attack.\n\n- Why is the block size ~1 MB in size? Why haven't block sizes of 1 GB been tried? Well, they have. Just not in Bitcoin specifically. Increasing block size and throughput have the impact of increasing the blockchain increases exponentially.\n- A large blockchain size makes it difficult for the average individual to run a Bitcoin node. Bitcoin nodes enforce the consensus rules. The sheer amount of Bitcoin nodes makes it difficult makes changes to the consensus rules - unless everyone agrees. Many Bitcoin nodes store full copies of the blockchain history, which as of this writing is still well under a terabyte.\n\n- The non-anonymity of the Bitcoin maintainers is a weak spot and easy target. The maintainers run Bitcoin Core, the main software client for a Bitcoin node. It's hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). This shouldn't be conflated with having _control_ over Bitcoin itself. Many people out there have mirrors and copies of the source code in the event that the main code repository is compromised. It's mostly low hanging fruit. Each node has individual say over whether or not to update to a new version of Bitcoin Core.\n\n## Bitcoin Privacy\n- Bitcoin the ledger is not private at all. That's the intention. Without the global distributed ledger, nobody would be able to verify transactions.\n- Coinjoin is a privacy tool that prevents this and there are different types of implementations, each with their own take on the same basic idea. Two or more users pool their UTXOs together into a collaborative transaction that is formed in a unique way. The way the transaction is constructed makes it very difficult for surveillance firms to know exactly which transaction output belongs to which of the input owners.\n- This is where the separation part comes in. A proper coinjoin implementation will completely break all deterministic links with the coins 'pre coinjoin' past. At best anyone looking at the transaction can come up with a number of possible scenarios as to who owns which piece of bitcoin but they can never be 100% sure. Now imagine you carry out multiple rounds of coinjoin one after the other, the transaction graph quickly becomes very confusing and impossible to track.\n- https://bitcoin-only.com/#privacy\n- https://bitcoiner.guide/privacy/separate/\n\n## Bitcoin Transaction Fees\n- Bitcoin transaction volume may not be enough to support the network's security budget in the long term. In 2024, the block subsidy will halve from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. It will take a long time for the subsidy to be zero, but in 2028 it will be 1.56 BTC. In 2032 it will be 0.78 BTC, then .3906 BTC in 2036. The majority of potential money for the entire economy of miner's can earn will someday have to come from transaction fees. If this model works, Bitcoin transactions transactions will be astronomically expensive to make on-chain. If other blockchains keep the demand for Bitcoin blockspace low enough, Bitcoin fees will remain low, and miners will have become unprofitable, and stop mining. This would cause the security budget to go down, making Bitcoin susceptible to a 51% attack.\n\n## Updates to Bitcoin\n- Bitcoin generally updates through \"soft-forks\", which means that every future network update must be backwards compatible. Hard forks, on the other hand, always create a chain split, the old chain is often abandoned, which Ethereum has managed to operationalize well. Ethereum has hard forked 10 times (see: [History of Ethereum Hard Forks](https://medium.com/mycrypto/the-history-of-ethereum-hard-forks-6a6dae76d56f)). Soft forks can be thought of as simple \"network upgrades\", while hard forks literally create 2 networks, the nodes on one network running the new, non-backwards compatible software, while the nodes on the old network are still running the previous, incompatible version of software.\n\n## Additional Resources and Links\n- [Clark Moody's Dashboard](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/)","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.044369068Z","tags":null},"/notes/blueberry-oatmeal":{"title":"Blueberry Oatmeal","content":"## Steps \n- Make oatmeal on stove or in microwave.\n- Throw Trader Joe's organic frozen blueberries in halfway through.\n- Mix in desired amount of chia seeds and serve.","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.044369068Z","tags":null},"/notes/bone-broth-rice":{"title":"Bone Broth Rice","content":"## Ingredients\n- Use 1:2 ratio cups of rice to cups of bone broth.\n - For example, 1 cup of rice and 2 cups of bone broth.\n- 1-2 tbs of organic grass fed butter.\n\n## Cooking Instructions\n- Bring 2 cup of organic bone broth and 1 tbs of butter to a light boil\n- Add 1 cup of Spanish rice, stir for one minute, then reduce to a covered simmer for 15-17 minutes.","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.044369068Z","tags":null},"/notes/creamy-tortellini-spinach-chicken-soup":{"title":"Creamy Tortellini Spinach Chicken Soup","content":"## Cooking equipment\n- Instant Pot\n- 1 tbsp measure\n- 1/2 tsp measure\n- 1 cup measure\n- 1/2 cup measure\n## Ingredients\n- 1 tbsp of Olive oil\n- 1 yellow onion, diced\n- 3 tsp garlic minced\n- 4 cups chicken broth\n- 1 to 1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n- 1 Tbsp dried basil\n- 2 Tbsp tomato paste\n- 2 (14.5 oz) cans petite diced tomatoes\n- 1 tsp salt\n- 1/2 tsp pepper\n- 1 cup heavy cream or 1 cup half and half\n- 4 cups frozen cheese tortellini (or you can use fresh)\n- 3 cups packed spinach (you can definitely add more than this if you want)\n- 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese\n## Steps\n1.

(340 g) Salmon, cut into 2-3 fillet strips\n- Salt\n- Black Pepper\n- 1 pinch of Cayenne Pepper\n- 2 tablespoons of Honey\n- 1 tablespoon warm water\n- 1 tablespoon of Olive Oil\n- 1 tablespoon of Minced Garlic\n- 1 tablespoon of Parsley\n- 1 1/2 teaspoons of Apple Cider Vinegar or Lemon Juice\n- 1/2 lemon, sliced into wedges\n## Instructions\n1. Season the surface of the salmon with salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper. Set aside.\n2. Mix the honey, water, apple cider vinegar or lemon juice and a pinch of salt together. Stir to combine well.\n3. Heat up an oven-safe skillet (cast-iron skillet preferred) on high heat. Add the olive oil. Pan-fry the salmon, skin side down first, for about 1 minute. Turn the salmon over and cook for 1 minute. Turn it over again so the skin side is at the bottom.\n4. Add the garlic into the pan, saute until slightly browned. Add the honey mixture and lemon wedges into the skillet, reduce the sauce until it's sticky.\n5. Finish it off by broiling the salmon in the oven for 1 minute or until the surface becomes slightly charred (optional step).\n6. Top the salmon with parsley and serve immediately. Internal temperature should reach 125 to 130 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n## Oven Version\nI just use oil. I coat the entire fillet (or steak) in veggie oil or olive oil, and put it skin-side-down in an old pan into a preheated 450+ degree oven. You'll have to try this like 10 times in order to learn your exact oven temperature and salmon cooking time. When I cook a 140 gram (1/3 lb) fillet for myself that's about 3 cm (1 1/4 inch) thick, I cook it about 9 minutes 50 seconds. (Don't open the oven while it's cooking.) Eat the salmon the instant it doesn't burn your mouth. It should melt in your mouth.\n\nI've also seen people sprinkle sugar on top of the oil before cooking, and that comes out nicely. When peaches or apricots or plums are in season, sometimes I chop one up and add it on top of the salmon _after_ the salmon is cooked. Or, as you say, salmon goes well with soy sauce, sesame oil, etc. But properly cooked salmon is delicious all by itself with only veggie oil, so everything else is optional.","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.044369068Z","tags":null},"/notes/intellij":{"title":"Intellij","content":"- Open/Close Terminal\n```\noption + fn + f12\n```\n \n- Open/Close Project Explorer\n```\ncmd + 1\n```\n\n- If you'd like to view files in an open Intellij project across multiple monitors, simply drag a file off screen onto another monitor screen to initiate that behavior.\n\n- Views -\u003e Tool Windows -\u003e Database\n\n- In a running debugger, you can add a new Watcher, with the following command, to allow you to pretty print your object as JSON.

The main difference: `mvn install` will also install the package into your local maven repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally.\n## Managing Parent POM and Child POMs\nTo match a parent POM, Maven uses two rules:\n1. There is a pom file in project’s root directory or in given relative path.\n2. Reference from child POM file contains the same coordinates as stated in the parent POM file.\n\nMaven parent pom can contain almost everything and those can be inherited into child pom files e.g\n\n- Common data – Developers’ names, SCM address, distribution management etc.\n- Constants – Such as version numbers\n- Common dependencies – Common to all child. It has same effect as writing them several times in individual pom files.\n- Properties – For example plugins, declarations, executions and IDs.\n- Configurations\n- Resources\n### Example Parent POM\n```xml\n\u003cproject xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsdr\"\u003e\n \u003cmodelVersion\u003e4.0.0\u003c/modelVersion\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003cgroupId\u003ecom.howtodoinjava.demo\u003c/groupId\u003e\n \u003cartifactId\u003eMavenExamples\u003c/artifactId\u003e\n \u003cversion\u003e0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\u003c/version\u003e\n \u003cpackaging\u003epom\u003c/packaging\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003cname\u003eMavenExamples Parent\u003c/name\u003e\n \u003curl\u003ehttp://maven.apache.org/\u003c/url\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003cproperties\u003e\n\t \u003cproject.build.sourceEncoding\u003eUTF-8\u003c/project.build.sourceEncoding\u003e\n\t \u003cjunit.version\u003e3.8.1\u003c/junit.version\u003e\n\t \u003cspring.version\u003e4.3.5.RELEASE\u003c/spring.version\u003e\n \u003c/properties\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003cdependencies\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003cdependency\u003e\n\t \u003cgroupId\u003ejunit\u003c/groupId\u003e\n\t \u003cartifactId\u003ejunit\u003c/artifactId\u003e\n\t \u003cversion\u003e${junit.version}\u003c/version\u003e\n\t \u003cscope\u003etest\u003c/scope\u003e\n \u003c/dependency\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003cdependency\u003e\n\t \u003cgroupId\u003eorg.springframework\u003c/groupId\u003e\n\t \u003cartifactId\u003espring-core\u003c/artifactId\u003e\n\t \u003cversion\u003e${spring.version}\u003c/version\u003e\n \u003c/dependency\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003c/dependencies\u003e\n\u003c/project\u003e\n```\n### Example Child POM\n```xml\n\u003cproject xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsdr\"\u003e\n \n\u003c!--The identifier of the parent POM--\u003e\n \u003cparent\u003e\n\t \u003cgroupId\u003ecom.howtodoinjava.demo\u003c/groupId\u003e\n\t \u003cartifactId\u003eMavenExamples\u003c/artifactId\u003e\n\t \u003cversion\u003e0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\u003c/version\u003e\n\u003c/parent\u003e\n\t\n \u003cmodelVersion\u003e4.0.0\u003c/modelVersion\u003e\n \u003cartifactId\u003eMavenExamples\u003c/artifactId\u003e\n \u003cname\u003eMavenExamples Child POM\u003c/name\u003e\n \u003cpackaging\u003ejar\u003c/packaging\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t \n \u003cdependencies\u003e\n\t \u003cdependency\u003e\n\t\t \u003cgroupId\u003eorg.springframework\u003c/groupId\u003e\n\t\t \u003cartifactId\u003espring-security\u003c/artifactId\u003e\n\t\t \u003cversion\u003e${spring.version}\u003c/version\u003e\n\t \u003c/dependency\u003e\n \u003c/dependencies\u003e\n\u003c/project\u003e\n```\n## Maven Snapshots\nA snapshot version in Maven is one that has not been released.\n\nThe idea is that **before** a `1.0` release (or any other release) is done, there exists a `1.0-SNAPSHOT`. That version is what _might become_ `1.0`. It's basically \"`1.0` under development\".\n\nThe difference between a \"real\" version and a snapshot version is that snapshots might get updates. That means that downloading `1.0-SNAPSHOT` today might give a different file than downloading it yesterday or tomorrow.\n\nUsually, snapshot dependencies should **only** exist during development and no released version (i.e. no non-snapshot) should have a dependency on a snapshot version.\n\nThe snapshot is _not_ necessarily more stable: it is just the latest build. The snapshot _precedes_ the actual release, it does not come after it.","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.052369124Z","tags":null},"/notes/news-articles-sites-blogs-poems":{"title":"News, Articles, Sites, Blogs, and Poems","content":"## News\n- [restofworld.org](https://restofworld.org/)\n- [aeon.co](https://aeon.co)\n- [texasmonthly.com](https://www.texasmonthly.com/)\n- [Hacker News - Y Combinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/)\n## Articles\n- [7 March 2022, Bretton Woods III - Zoltan Pozsar](https://plus2.credit-suisse.com/shorturlpdf.html?v=4ZR9-WTBd-VA)\n\u003e We are witnessing the birth of Bretton Woods III – a new world (monetary) order centered around commodity-based currencies in the East that will likely weaken the Eurodollar system and also contribute to inflationary forces in the West.\n- [Nuclear Reactor proposal in Washington State](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/environment/this-next-generation-nuclear-power-plant-is-pitched-for-washington-state-can-it-change-the-world/)\n\u003e X-energy, along with Bellevue-based TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, and Portland-based NuScale, proposes reactors that can ramp up and down their electrical output much more rapidly than the large reactors now operating.\n\u003e This agility could help keep electrical grids in balance as more wind and solar power comes online.\n- [This World of Ours by James Mickens](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1401_08-12_mickens.pdf)\n## Sites\n- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)\n\u003e We believe that a key reason why we fail to achieve the progress we are capable of is that we do not make enough use of this existing research and data: the important knowledge is often stored in inaccessible databases, locked away behind paywalls and buried under jargon in academic papers. \n\u003e The goal of our work is to make the knowledge on the big problems accessible and understandable.

So the larger your holdings, the more weight is given to your vote in achieving network consensus. You also receive a disproportionately large reward for validating blocks, compared to those that have less coins but provide the same service to the network. Over time, PoS centralizes the majority of consensus to a small number of validators that hold the most coins.\n\nComparing PoS to the monetary system in the US, and they are very similar. You're incentivized to invest money in assets like stocks, real estate, etc. because that's how you make a return on your money and outpace inflation. if you're an ultra high net worth individual, you can even afford to hire lobbyists to influence the laws that are made, or lawyers to help you find loopholes in the existing tax code. The more money you have, the easier it is to influence the system. This is not bad in and of itself, because if you can acquire capital, you are likely a competent person who is deserving of the money that you've made. But a bad actor takes the capital they've accumulated, and uses it to exploit and change the rules of the system to benefit themselves, it becomes harder for the system as a whole to continue to provide opportunity for good actors starting at the bottom rung and working their way upwards.\n\nA key governance difference between a Proof of Stake network and a Proof of Work network is that in Proof of Stake, more money affords you more power over the stewardship of the network. The more money you stake, the larger your yield will become, which over a long enough time horizon will consolidate wealth.","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.052369124Z","tags":null},"/notes/proof-of-work":{"title":"Proof of Work","content":"## Benefits \u0026 Issues of Proof of Work\nThere's a difference between users and miners (also known as block validators). Anyone can use a blockchain to make transactions or execute smart contracts. That's a user. A miner's purpose is to validate blocks of transactions. are incentivized to do so because they can earn a monetary reward. If you have a basic understanding of Bitcoin, you know that a new block is mined roughly every 10 minutes. A block is not unlimited in size in blockchain networks. With Bitcoin, for example, block size is capped at ~1 MB. It has to be a small block for a few reasons. decentralization, node validators, total size of blockchain exponentially grows as block size increases. When a new block is mined, it is added onto the end of the chain, hence the term blockchain.\n\n[Proof of Stake](/notes/proof-of-stake.md) protocols are a class of consensus mechanisms for blockchains that work by selecting validators in proportion to their quantity of holdings in the associated cryptocurrency.\n\nProof of Stake (PoS) gives mining power based on the percentage of coins held by a miner.\n\nPoW and PoS are the only network consensus mechanisms that I know of that work in practice. Someone could naively suggest a proof of user consensus, where one user equals one node in the network, but that doesn't work either, because nothing is stopping bad actors from provisioning N number of nodes on AWS, and boom, your network just forked because of a 51% attack.\n\nTying network consensus to real world electricity consumption, like BTC and ETH do, is problematic because of the carbon emissions caused by it.

This allows existing projects to replace performance-critical pieces with speedy Rust code without the memory safety risks inherent with other systems programming languages. Some projects have even been [incrementally rewritten in Rust](https://people.gnome.org/~federico/blog/librsvg-is-almost-rustified.html) using these techniques.\n\nSystems programming languages have the implicit expectation that they will be around effectively forever. While some modern development doesn’t require that amount of longevity, many businesses want to know that their fundamental code base will be usable for the foreseeable future. Rust recognizes this and has made conscious design decisions around backwards compatibility and stability; it’s a language [designed for the next 40 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3AdN7U24iU).\n\nMajor highlights of web development with Rust are:\n- You can compile Rust to [WebAssembly](https://simpleprogrammer.com/webassembly-finally-freed-javascript/) so it's easier to get near-native performance on the web.\n- Rust allows any language to compile into WebAssembly, thus allowing for portable, executable running code online.","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.052369124Z","tags":null},"/notes/sed":{"title":"Sed","content":"```bash\nsed -i '/^all:/ s/$/ anotherthing/' file\n```","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.052369124Z","tags":null},"/notes/shrimp-and-grits":{"title":"Shrimp \u0026 Grits","content":"## Ingredients\n\n### Shrimp \u0026 Bacon Ingredients\n- 4 pieces of bacon, cut in 1/4-inch pieces\n- 1 pound of unfrozen shrimp, peeled and deveined, can be cooked or uncooked\n- 1/2 tsp of Cajun seasoning  \n- 1/2 tsp of salt\n- 1/4 tsp of black pepper\n- Pinch of cayenne pepper\n- 1 tbsp of minced garlic\n- 2 tbsp of minced green onion\n- 1 tbsp of minced jalapeno\n- 1 tbsp of chopped parsley\n\n### Sauce Ingredients\n- 1/4 cup of water\n- 2 tbsp of cream\n- 2 tsp of lemon juice\n- A few drops of Worcestershire sauce\n\n### Grits Ingredients\n- 1 cup white grits  \n- 4 cups water\n- 1 teaspoon salt  \n- 2 tablespoons butter  \n- 1/2 cup grated white cheddar\n\n## Cooking Instructions\n1.

They are convenient in a number of situations, but cannot solve all problems.\n\u003e A common use for multiple workspaces is to create a parallel, distinct copy of a set of infrastructure in order to test a set of changes before modifying the main production infrastructure. For example, a developer working on a complex set of infrastructure changes might create a new temporary workspace in order to freely experiment with changes without affecting the default workspace.\n## Automation\n- [Automating Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/automate-terraform)\n\u003e ### Plan and Apply on different machines\n\u003e When running in an orchestration tool, it can be difficult or impossible to ensure that the `plan` and `apply` subcommands are run on the same machine, in the same directory, with all of the same files present.\n## Terraform Commands\n- `terraform refresh` is effectively an alias for `terraform apply -refresh-only -auto-approve` which is why it should _NEVER_ be used. It is far too risky to run `terraform refresh` without first reviewing the proposed state changes.\n- Instead, use `terraform apply -refresh-only`. This alternative command will present an interactive prompt for you to review and confirm the proposed state changes. After confirming, your Terraform remote state will be updated to match the settings of your managed remote objects. More info can be found about this in the Hashicorp documentation [here](https://www.terraform.io/cli/commands/refresh#command-refresh).\n- `terraform init`\n\t- The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version control. It is safe to run this command multiple times.\n- Terraform prints output values to the screen when a configuration is applied, but Terraform can also query all output values with the `terraform output` command, or selectively query certain output values using the below command template:\n```\nterraform output $RESOURCE_NAME\n```\n## Terraform Tips and Tricks\n- You can use `-target` to plan/apply a [specific Terraform resource](https://devops.stackexchange.com/questions/4292/terraform-apply-only-one-tf-file) within a module. **Be careful**, this is an advanced way to use Terraform and could break your infrastructure if done improperly.\n```\nterraform apply -target=aws_security_group.my_sg\n```\n- Turn on Verbose Logging by setting the TF_LOG environment variable to 1. 0 turns off logging.\n```\nexport TF_LOG=1\n```\n- `tfenv` is a useful cli tool that can be used to easily switch between different versions of Terraform.\n```\nbrew install tfenv\ntfenv install 1.0.0\ntfenv use 1.0.0\nterraform version # verify you're using the right version\n```","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.052369124Z","tags":null},"/notes/tor":{"title":"Tor","content":"The core principle of Tor, [Onion routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing \"Onion routing\"), was developed in the mid-1990s by United States Naval Research Laboratory employees, mathematician Paul Syverson, and computer scientists Michael G.

Onion routing is implemented by encryption in the application layer of the communication protocol stack, nested like the layers of an onion. The alpha version of Tor, developed by Syverson and computer scientists Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson and then called The Onion Routing project (which later simply became \"Tor\", as an acronym for the former name, was launched on 20 September 2002. The first public release occurred a year later.\n\nIn 2004, the Naval Research Laboratory released the code for Tor under a free license, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) began funding Dingledine and Mathewson to continue its development. In 2006, Dingledine, Mathewson, and five others founded The Tor Project, a Massachusetts-based 501(c)(3) research-education nonprofit organization responsible for maintaining Tor. The EFF acted as The Tor Project's fiscal sponsor in its early years, and early financial supporters of The Tor Project included the U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor and International Broadcasting Bureau, Human Rights Watch, the University of Cambridge, and Google.\n\nOver the course of its existence, various Tor [attacks and weaknesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)#Weaknesses) have been discovered and occasionally used.

First, Vim (or vi) is almost guaranteed to be installed on any remote server you may need to ssh into. Second, although Vim was released in 1991, it's widely available as a plugin on modern IDEs, like Intellij, VS Code, Eclipse, etc. Third, once you're comfortable with the controls, Vim allows you to quickly navigate to any place on the page with precision. Combining that with the ability to record chains of commands and replay them, it allows for programmatic editing of files on the fly. Once you're comfortable with Vim, you have a text editor at your service that you can on virtually any server.\n\n## Vim Commands\n- [Vim Cheat Sheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/)\n\n### Sort Commands\nThe following command sorts all lines and removes duplicate lines:\n```\n:sort u\n```\n\n### Search Commands\nSearch for lines containing this pattern `- **`: `?` + `- \\*\\*`\n\nFind and Replace: `%s/foo/bar/g`\n\nThe traditional approach to find lines not matching a pattern is using the :v command:\n  - `:v/Warning/p`\n  - `:v/Warning/d` (NOTE: this deletes every line that does NOT match this pattern)\n\n### Navigation Commands\n- `)` or `shift + 0` to drop to the next newline\n- `u` is undo and `ctrl + r` to redo\n\n### Record Macro Commands\n- Press `q` then any letter to start recording in a register (ex: `qq`)\n- Perform command(s)\n- Press `q` to stop recording\n- Press `N@q` to run the macro stored in the q register N times\n\n### Window Panes in Vim\n- Add this to the .vimrc in your home user's directory to use the mouse in vim: `set mouse=a`\n- Use `:Vex` to open a filesystem navigation window in vim\n- Use `:ter` or `:vert ter` to open up a shell window\n- The mouse access allows you to resize windows and click through a filesystem menu\n\n### Regex for Number Searches\nRegex syntax is a little crazy in Vim, but being able to record macros that search for certain patterns is very useful for extracting data.\n\nSearch numbers of fixed length say 5 (matches `12345`, `123456`). Numbers more than 5 digits contain substring of 5 digits, and are also found by this regex.\n```\n/\\d\\{5\\}\n```\n\nword boundary start:\n```\n\\\u003c\n```\n\nword boundary end:\n```\n\\\u003e\n```\n\nThen use below to search numbers of exact 5 digits (match 12345 but not 123456):\n```\n/\\\u003c\\d\\{5\\}\\\u003e\n```\n\nUse below to search numbers of 5 or more digits:\n```\n/\\\u003c\\d\\{5,\\}\\\u003e\n```\n\nUse below to search numbers of 5 to 8 digits:\n```\n/\\\u003c\\d\\{5,8\\}\\\u003e\n```\n\nUse below to search numbers of 8 or less digits:\n```\n/\\\u003c\\d\\{,8\\}\\\u003e\n```\n\nShortcut numbers of 1 or more digits\n\n```\n/\\d\\+\n```\n\n## .vimrc file\n```\nset nu\nset relativenumber\nset scrolloff=8\nset mouse=a\nset ttymouse=sgr\nset clipboard=unnamed\n```","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.052369124Z","tags":null},"/notes/vs-code":{"title":"VS Code","content":"Search for files: `Cmd ⌘+p`","lastmodified":"2022-04-27T20:16:53.052369124Z","tags":null}}
